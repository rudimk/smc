The PatchValueCache is used to cache values returned
by SortedPatchList.value.  Caching is critical, since otherwise
the client may have to apply hundreds of patches after ever
few keystrokes, which would make SMC unusable.  Also, the
history browser is very painful to use without caching.

###
The SyncDoc class enables synchronized editing of a document that can be represented by a string.

EVENTS:

 - 'change' event whenever the document is changed *remotely* (NOT locally), and also once
   when document is initialized.

 - 'user_change' when the string is definitely changed locally (so a new patch is recorded)

STATES:
